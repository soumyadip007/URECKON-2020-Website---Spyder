Today information technology is a natural and widely accepted part of our lives. It surrounds us, powering most of the things we do, and we interact with it practically every second, often without realizing it. As it is such a vital part of the way we live today,<b>Swasthai Sampad</b> believes that technology should be designed to fit users and that the road to innovative success should be about simplicity – not complexity. We believe that technology – however advanced it may be – should be unobtrusive, easy and enjoyable to experience and as simple to use as the box it comes in. Our philosophy on technology is a vital part of the company mission statement and has its place at the core of our business. Please read more under ‘Core Technology’ to get the technical perspective on the essence of our tech approach.
